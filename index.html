			<h2>My hobbies 🐎🏃‍♀️:</h2>
			<p>
			I really enjoy practicing sports since my earliest childhood. I like going to the gym, playing volleyball, athletics, practicing horse-riding and many more! So you won't be surprised if I say I am a dynamique person ;) This hobby for sports helped me to gain confidence, team spirit and always give my best in everything I do.

			<h2>My passions 🦌:</h2>
			<p>
			I have always been passionate about animals. What are their characteristics, how they survive in a specific environment, their speed, when they hibernate if they do, how they feed themselves etc. I watch a lot of documentaries to learn more and more about it, and it really never gets me bored ! And you, what's your passion about?

			<h2>My projects 🙌:</h2>
			<p>
			After obtaining my Bachelor's degree, I am planning to do a Master of Journalism because I am really interested by the media-audiovisual domain. Then, I would like to integrate an brand where I would, I hope, have the opportunity to travel and work all around the world. Since I have already lived in three different continents at only the age of 18 years old, I am even more curious to discover more countries and cultures.
